# Blue Ocean

## Overview
Blue Ocean is a sophisticated marine monitoring buoy designed to provide real-time data on sea levels and water quality. It integrates advanced sensors to measure turbulence, pH levels, and Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), making it an invaluable tool for environmental research and the study of ocean health.

### Key Technologies
- **3D Design**: for the physical structure and buoy modeling.
- **HTML & CSS**: for crafting the user interface.
- **Node.js & JavaScript**: for backend development and data handling.
- **Python**: for data analysis and sensor integration.
- **Arduino**: for hardware control and sensor data collection.
- **MySQL**: for database management and data storage.

## Features
- **Real-Time Data Monitoring**: Track sea level changes and water quality metrics continuously.
- **Advanced Sensor Array**: Includes sensors for turbulence, pH, and TDS.
- **Robust Design**: Engineered for long-term deployment in various marine environments.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy to navigate web interface for data visualization and analysis.
